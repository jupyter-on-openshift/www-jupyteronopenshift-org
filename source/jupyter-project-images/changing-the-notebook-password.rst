Changing the Notebook Password
------------------------------

The password for the notebook is supplied as a template parameter, or if
not supplied will be automatically generated by the template. It will be
passed into the container through an environment variable.

If you want to change the password, you can do so by editing the
environment variable on the deployment configuration.

::

    oc set env dc/mynotebook JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD=mypassword

This will trigger a new deployment so ensure you have downloaded any work
if not using a persistent volume.

If using a persistent volume, you could instead setup a password in the
file::

    /home/jovyan/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

as per guidelines in:
